        so she doesnt feel bihari when seeing my english
        bihari = illitarate
        she doesnt feel illitarate so i make her feel litarate
        she feels good and intelligent after seeing my rubbish english
        oh so does that imply i look more bihari= illiatarate in that manner then her and she feels better 
        no no no nooooooooo
        i make myself look like a joker a clown a fricking jester infront of others 
        lol im such a joker 
        this makes me feel sad why did she say that and also implied honestly after that and that proves my point of how will i represent myself in front of others when talking
        while i cant even form a sentence properly 
        she reads novels her vocabulary is good and that is a very great thing ive also read a single novel and i could only learn and remember a few words whose pronunciation is still
        unknown to me till this day this time why am i so bad in so many things i should read more novels more books and more about more and more more more
        i need to vent my anger my frustrations somewhere but that wouldnt cure the wound the damage the pain all that stuff which im going through right now 
        how can i say this this thing is so damn awful for me im litarally using so many common words in my speech it just makes me one of all the plain human beings in history
        how can i rise how can i improve how can i be better
        i know how
        i need that pain 
        i need it 
        the pain is the only thing that makes a man better makes his work count makes him better and what else does a man want then be better then his yestarday
        i cant keep living like the pest i am right now 
        i have to get better or get crushed under other best players of the game im still unable to level up my game i should just give up at this point 
        no there is no point in giving up
        feel this pain 
        this pain is all yours
        these hurting fingers these paining memories all of the pain which ive accumulated throughout the years i shall forge into this speech
        this useless baseless sentances which i weave from my useless inner hate i just hate the way i am i just hate the way i live 
        i just hate i cant get over this im crushed under this pain this thing that made me feel pain this internet this online world it is only temperary but the people in it who talk
        who spell their feelings express their feeling through the mere medium of internet through their heart they also tell these things to these other people other pests of the internet
        we all are here trapped who cant escape who only has this world of internet and cant have a real life like me but.. but ... they have a life outside of the internet
        i feel bad all of a sudden
        i am the one who doesnt have a place to go i am the one who is lonely and alone all the time 
        i came to the internet to find some friends and what i got?
        more loneliness more stubborness, more pain, more damage then i expected i think i am the one who is at the wrong here i was the one who took their words to my heart
        i was the one who just said, hey you know what they think you are, yes they think you are just trying to be cool by speaking english and u also know deep inside
        how much you like speaking this language as well as how bad you are at the language you know what you should practice more on speaking english then typing it using your
        brains full power it will be better if you talked with someone in english and tried to use more and more of it in the future that way you would actaully get better
        so please use your brain and please practice more
        only you know how bad you are and only you can know your true self and no one else because that is you your YOU not other's please love yourSELF because only you can truly
        trust yourself on this no one can love you like you can please dont give up please please please i hate to admit it to you but you know that you truly are alone and without any 
        companion to hold onto the only closure you got was your own tears at night with nothing but a pillow to hold onto you know your situation then why are you still like this 
        please please change for your well being please go out more and explore the world more get a new job get at some point in life where you can say i know this was all i needed 
        to cling onto get that thing where u can say, hey i know how much of a failure i was i know how much bad how much useless i was to so many people and the harm i brought to others 
        please dont kill yourself over such things i know these will just speed up the process and the progress of your bravery will increase and you will take that step and die
        because death is the only time where you can truly rest now even when you're doing nothing and just being a breathing living useless human that you are who just exploits his 
        bigger human to get what he wants from their money which they brought from their effort and feed you for free you are just a pest in this vast world you're even burden to those
        who serve their life for you. and in return what do you do for them huh, say demeanig words to them when you're angry, when you cant control your tongue you should be 
        ashamed of yourself you know you are a bad person and knowing that you are a bad person you still dont change 
        still sitting there and writing this as if it would change anything for better
        no never you're never going to go anywhere from this you better be dead then writing this 
        you truly are despicable please stop writing this and now go to work and complete that work of yours now stop crying now now boy pick yourself up 
        you know you can do this this was just a small pebble like insult which was not even intentional you know right 
        she was just kidding to get few laughs out of people and you are taking that joke that small act of foolary too far so please dont beat yourself for such a small thing
        dont lose hope please dont you are the only one on whom i can count on i just wanna tell you that whatever you do i know i know that you may not be good in it but please 
        please dont give up on yourself if you gave up who will support you 
        no one you are the only one who can cheer yourself up i just cannot die somehow i just want someone to kill me i would fight for my life one last time with the andrenalline rush 
        for the last time you will lose or just live another life after defeating that death 
        i love you lana blakely why the world isnt the good place how can i be a better person i wanna be kind like you but i will become boring on the internet 
        i love you not the way a man would love a women but you truly brought good things in my life whenever i felt bad i watched your calm and soothing videos
        which were made for miserable people like me who cannot get a human connection in this vast world i hope you get all the happy things you could get
        i just wanna thank you when ill grow up ill definately send you money as my gratitude because that is the only thing i can do to help you 
        i hope ill be able to do that i dont wanna be that poor that i cant even donate some money to you 
        you helped me so many times when the times were bad i couldnt control myself i couldnt stop those tears i just wish i could die any moment
        im just so scared and cant suicide on my own i just want someone to kill me how useless i am right cant even kill myself 
        you say no one thinks as badly of me then myself i agree with you but i wanna love myself i dont wanna hate myself like thing 
        its so painful i wish i wish someone could please come and kill me oh i know what to do 
        i can manifest even though the thing is truly useless how come such thing like manifestation work in this world of steve jobs and david goggins these people didnt do manifest
        they carved their own path from their pain and im here cant even muster up the courage to kill myself 
        i will manifest my death 
        i wish someone could live on the price of my life i wish i could have the chance to sacrifice my life for someone
