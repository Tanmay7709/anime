hello

this is where ill store how the file would be pushed to github this is the code here 

first there would be path to the project file
optional: to check git status 
git add . (for all files) / git add fileName.txt (for a specific file)
to commit changes and add msg afterwards about changes in the double inverted commas
to push the file in the repository
then it will ask for username and password key after that
